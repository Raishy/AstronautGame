# Astronaut Game
This game was created using the Unity Game Engine and by a team of 5 students. Most models were made using Blender and most of the textures are from the Unity asset store. This game is not finished and the "end" of the demo is reaching the top of a building with a modeled dragon on top of it. Entire dev time was 3 months.   

To Run the game

Known Bugs   
1. Falling of a building will instantly drop you to the floor   
2. If you take any damage from robots and then kill them, the game will instantly restart.(Best to reach the end without taking damage).   
3. Running into robots will sometimes push you off the path and will prevent you from completing the level.
